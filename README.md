# Classification of house numbers

My attempt at classification of numbers from SVHN dataset with some simple preprocessing. For my implementation I closely followed the solution presented in "Multi-digit Number Recognition from Street View Imagery using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks."
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook tutorial and all the necessary code, data, and documentation to reproduce the analysis and predictions.
